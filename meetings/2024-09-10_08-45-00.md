## Meeting Information

**Meeting Date/Time:** 2024-09-10, 8:45 AM  
**Note Taker:** Limitless, ChatGPT (Summarization)

## Attendees

People who attended: Jason, Sarah, Owen, Alex, Sahib, Dr. Mehdi

## Agenda Items

1. Review and confirm project proposal for AI meeting bot.
2. Discuss technical feasibility and scope of the project.
3. Feedback on project requirements and potential improvements.

## Discussion Items

### Project Overview

- The team presented a draft for their project proposal, which involves developing an open-source meeting bot API that integrates with platforms like Zoom, Teams, and Google Meet.
- The bot will automatically join scheduled meetings, record audio, and store it in an S3 bucket.
- The API will allow developers to build applications on top of the recorded data (e.g., transcription, summarization).
- Architecture includes a front end for configuration, a back end for controlling bots, and AWS infrastructure for scalability.

### Feasibility of Integration with Meeting Platforms

- Zoom has a direct API that can be used for integration.
- Google Meet lacks a direct API, requiring the use of a headless browser to extract the audio stream.
- Uncertainty remains about Microsoft Teams' API capabilities.

### Purpose and Differentiation

- Unlike Zoom's user-facing recording and transcription, this bot operates automatically via an API, making it easier for third-party developers to build applications without manual intervention.
- The team highlighted that this is a tool for developers, with a universal use case for multiple industries.

### Project Scope and Example Applications

- The bot will initially record meetings to an MP3 file, with potential future features like transcription and summarization.
- The team discussed building example applications, such as an AI sales coach or a meeting summarizer, to demonstrate the bot's utility.

### Feedback on Improvements

- Dr. Mehdi suggested creating simple demo applications to showcase the bot's capabilities, such as connecting it to GPT for summarization and action item extraction.
- These examples would provide clarity on how the bot can be used in real-world applications, such as sales coaching or generating meeting summaries.

### Team Capacity and Development Targets

- The project is well-suited for the team size, but Dr. Mehdi emphasized ensuring a working demo by the end, capable of being deployed and tested on platforms like Zoom.

## Action Items

- **Jason**: Investigate the API capabilities of Microsoft Teams.
- **Anyone**: Flesh out the project requirements and develop simple example applications (e.g., meeting summarizer).
- **Anyone**: Prepare the Software Requirements Specification (SRS) document, with a focus on high-priority features.
- **Sarah**: Coordinate with the industry partner to validate the integration within their AI sales coach.
- **Owen**: Ensure that the demo version can be deployed on Zoom for testing.
