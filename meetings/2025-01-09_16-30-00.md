## Discussion Items

### Project Milestones and Sprint Goals
- Reviewed P1 requirements and established milestone deadlines (finalizing required features by February 13, 2025).
- Importance of achieving incremental weekly goals with flexibility for adjustments.
- "Video upload" is categorized as a nice-to-have feature.

### Backend Development
- Focus on internal deployment of the system to test endpoint functionality.
- Backend transition from Python to JavaScript using Express and tRPC for type safety.
- Tasks include creating "create bot" and "get bot" API endpoints, ensuring concurrency for bot deployment, and integrating config files.

### Heartbeat Mechanism
- **Purpose**: To provide real-time updates on the bot's status, ensuring that the backend is always aware of the bot's current state and whether it's functioning as expected.
- **Mechanism**: The bot periodically sends "heartbeat" messages to the backend, containing its state and other relevant data (e.g., meeting status, any events logged).

**Proposed Implementation Details**:

1. **Initiation**:
    - A background asynchronous function starts when the bot is deployed.
    - This function is responsible for sending periodic updates to the backend.
2. **State Sharing**:
    - The bot maintains a global or shared state, which the asynchronous function accesses.
    - The state includes critical information like:
        - Current task (e.g., in a meeting, idle).
        - Errors or issues encountered.
        - Event logs.
3. **Periodic Updates**:
    - The asynchronous function uses a timed loop (e.g., `setTimeout` or similar) to send updates at regular intervals (e.g., every 3 seconds).
    - These updates are sent to a dedicated "heartbeat endpoint" on the backend.
4. **Backend Handling**:
    - The backend processes the incoming heartbeat messages to:
        - Monitor the bot's activity.
        - Detect issues (e.g., no heartbeat for a prolonged period may indicate a failure).
        - Log events for auditing or debugging.
5. **Fallback for Missing Heartbeats**:
    - If a bot fails to send a heartbeat within an expected timeframe, the backend can initiate recovery actions, such as:
        - Notifying the team of a potential failure.
        - Attempting to restart the bot.

### **Development Plan**

- **Short-Term**:
    - Develop the asynchronous function in the bot code and log heartbeat updates locally (e.g., to the console) for testing.
    - Backend team creates a placeholder endpoint for the heartbeat.
- **Long-Term**:
    - Integrate the heartbeat mechanism with the backend when the endpoint is ready.
    - Finalize the structure of the state object sent in heartbeat messages.

This system ensures robust monitoring of deployed bots and helps preemptively address failures.

### Design Document
- Components and responsibilities outlined for the upcoming assignment.
- Use of Figma for diagrams: front-end UI, sequence diagrams, database schema.
- Targeting six to eight pages with potential appendix for detailed UI diagrams.

### Work Session Scheduling
- Weekly meetings set, with additional ad hoc work periods for collaboration.
- Next work session scheduled for Monday, January 13, 2025, 9:30â€“11:30 am, hybrid format (H203 room and online).

## Action Items

- **Sarah**: Creat front-end UI diagram on Figma; prepare roadmap and share with stakeholders via Discord and email; coordinate tasks with Jason.
- **Owen**: Switch backend to JavaScript.
- **Alex**: Finalize bot modularization and dummy callback setup. Work on sequence diagram.
- **Sahib**: Generate database schema diagram using AI tools or manually.
- **Jason**: Give thoughts on heartbeat mechanism discussed; continue working on infrastructure tasks.
- **Anyone**:  
  - Create and integrate example `config.json` and `.env` files.
  - Ensure proper git ignore for temporary config files.
